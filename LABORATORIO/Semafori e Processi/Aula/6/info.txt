Sleeping Barber problem in Process Synchronization

Problem : The analogy is based upon a 
hypothetical barber shop with one barber. 
There is a barber shop which has one barber, one barber chair,
 and n chairs for waiting for customers 
 if there are any to sit on the chair.

    -If there is no customer, then the barber sleeps in his own chair.
    -When a customer arrives, he has to wake up the barber.
    -If there are many customers and the barber is 
    cutting a customerâ€™s hair, then the remaining customers 
    either wait if there are empty chairs in the waiting room or 
    they leave if no chairs are empty.
